Andle is an authoring system for creating traditional adventure gamebooks in paper and epub format. It provides a (soon to be) powerfull editor that allows anyone to create professional looking adventure gamebooks.

# Status

At the moment Andle. is just an experiment and is not in a usable state.

# Roadmap

The following is a list of things I want to do when I find the time. This list is roughly in order.

* **Get the first release out**
  * The first release should be an standalone IDE that supports writing a simple adventure book (Kolb & the Dragon style) and compile it to either an EPUB or LaTeX document with a single button click.
* **Subjects**
  * A way for writers to define their own pieces of data and templates to fill them out. These can then be references to from a Andle book.
* **Improve editors**
  * Implement custom editors that are more suitable for writing stories rather then writing code. This will also include writing custom editors for Subjects.
* **Andle Code**
  * A large and probably the most involved features that nevers gets finished. Andle.Code gives the author the ability to use boolean, numerical and string values and if branches. This will then be compiled into a static Book. Limitations apply.
